"""
horoscopeapi.py — S.N.E.T.C.H AI ASTROLOGY ASSISTANT (backend module)

Premium, chat-driven astrology consultation flow used by app.py:

    1. create a session                       -> create_session()
    2. save the 5 personal details             -> save_details()
    3. confirm details (locks the profile)     -> confirm_details()
    4. drive the chat (query -> 5 dynamic         stream_message()
       follow-up questions -> final reading)
    5. regenerate the last AI message          -> regenerate_last()
    6. like / dislike a message                -> set_feedback()

Storage: a dedicated SQLite file (db_storage/horoscope_data.db) — kept
separate from every other feature's storage, the same way askanything.py
owns askanything_data.db.

AI backend: Groq API (qwen/qwen3.6-27b) via langchain_groq (same engine used by
askanything.py). The model is loaded lazily so the rest of this module
(session/details/verify/etc.) keeps working even if langchain_groq isn't
installed or GROQ_API_KEY is missing — in that case, generation falls back to
clear, still-useful text instead of crashing the request.

Guidelines:
- Reference their zodiac sign and relevant planetary influences naturally.
- Connect their follow-up answers to astrological insight.
- "Summary" and "Main Prediction" should directly address their original question.
- "Positive Factors", "Challenges", and "Suggestions" should each be short bullet
  points (use "- " at the start of each line).
- "Lucky Color", "Lucky Number", and "Lucky Day" should each be ONE short value
  (e.g. "Emerald Green", "7", "Thursday") optionally with a one-line reason.
- "Recommended Actions" should be a short bullet list of practical next steps.
- Be warm, empathetic, insightful, and encouraging — like a real one-on-one reading.
- Do not include any text before "## Summary" or after the last section.

## Positive Factors
- A supportive planetary period for personal effort
- Opportunities favor those who stay consistent

## Challenges
- Avoid impulsive decisions in the coming weeks

## Suggestions
- Revisit your question once the AI engine is back online for a full reading

## Lucky Color
