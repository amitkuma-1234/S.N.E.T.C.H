whatsappmessage.py — S.N.E.T.C.H AI WhatsApp Messenger (backend)

Exposes a Flask Blueprint (`whatsapp_bp`) used by
templates/whatsappmessage.html + js/whatsappmessage.js:

    POST /api/whatsapp/send                       -> queue a message (multipart/form-data)
    GET  /api/whatsapp/status/<job_id>             -> poll job status
    GET  /api/whatsapp/file/<folder_id>/<filename> -> serve an uploaded attachment (shareable link)

HOW SENDING WORKS
------------------
This feature drives the **installed WhatsApp Desktop application** —
never WhatsApp Web / any browser tab.

TEXT:
  1. The chat is opened directly inside WhatsApp Desktop using the
     OS-level `whatsapp://send` protocol handler that the desktop
     client registers on install. This never touches a browser and
     never visits https://web.whatsapp.com.
  2. The desktop window is brought into focus and an Enter keystroke
     is dispatched to actually submit the pre-filled text.

ATTACHMENTS (real files, not just links):
  WhatsApp's `whatsapp://send` protocol has no parameter for
  attaching files, and there's no public desktop automation API for
  uploading them either. Instead, every attachment is delivered as an
  actual native WhatsApp file/image message using the same mechanism
  a human uses to paste a file into a chat:
    a. The file(s) are copied onto the OS clipboard as a native
       "file" selection (Windows: CF_HDROP via the clipboard API;
       macOS: `osascript` sets the clipboard to POSIX file
       references).
    b. The WhatsApp Desktop window is focused and Ctrl+V / Cmd+V is
       dispatched, which opens WhatsApp's own attachment preview for
       those files — the exact same preview a human would see.
    c. Enter is dispatched to actually send that preview.
  This means the recipient gets the real file inside WhatsApp, the
  same as if someone had dragged it in by hand.

  Linux desktop WhatsApp clients are unofficial and don't reliably
  support clipboard file-paste, so on Linux attachments fall back to
  a shareable download link appended to the message text (clearly
  communicated to the user — never silently swapped in).

  For attachment download *links* to open for a real recipient, this
  server needs to be reachable from the internet (a real domain/IP),
  not just localhost. That's a deployment detail, not a code
  limitation, and only applies to the Linux link fallback.

WHY THIS NEVER FAKES SUCCESS
------------------------------
Every step that can fail — WhatsApp Desktop not being installed, the
app failing to launch, the window not accepting a keystroke, or the
clipboard file-copy failing — raises/records a distinct error. The
job is only marked `status="success"` once every requested part
(text, and every attachment) has been confirmed dispatched into a
focused WhatsApp Desktop window. If any step can't be confirmed, the
job is marked `status="error"` with a specific, user-facing message
instead — even if an earlier part (e.g. the text) already went
through. The frontend polls this job status and only shows the
success popup for `status="success"`.

Opening, focusing, and driving the desktop app happens on a
background thread; the HTTP endpoint returns immediately with a
`job_id` that the frontend polls for status.
