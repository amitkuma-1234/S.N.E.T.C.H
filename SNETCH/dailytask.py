"""
S.N.E.T.C.H — DAILY TASK MODULE (Web Edition)
Set | Update | Delete | List tasks, each with its own task-tone playlist.

Data:  daily_routine.json   (list of task dicts)
Tones: task_tone/           (downloaded / stored .mp3 tone files)

This module is the backend for the Daily Task Manager web feature. It is
imported by app.py and exposes small, non-interactive "api_*" functions
that the Flask routes call directly — mirroring the same pattern used by
alarm.py for its tones/alarms API.

TASK TONE PLAYLIST
------------------
Each task now stores an ORDERED list of tone filenames ("tones") instead
of a single tone. When the task is running, the frontend plays them back
Song1 -> Song2 -> Song3 -> ... -> repeat, in exactly the order the user
picked them in — never shuffled. If the user chose "Skip", the task's
"skip" flag is set and "tones" is forced empty: no background music plays
for that task at all.

FIRE ALARM (TASK START / END WARNING)
--------------------------------------
task_tone/fire_alarm.mp3 is a reserved system warning tone. It must NEVER
appear in the Task Tone List and must NEVER be selectable by the user as
a task tone. It is deliberately excluded from get_task_tones() /
api_get_tone_list() and from every validated tone list. It is only
exposed through the dedicated api_get_fire_alarm() function, which the
frontend uses to play it for exactly 2 seconds before a task starts and
exactly 2 seconds before a task ends.
