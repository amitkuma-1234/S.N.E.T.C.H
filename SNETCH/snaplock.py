snaplock.py — S.N.E.T.C.H SnapLock: AI Powered Object Security Vault
=======================================================================

Flask blueprint (mounted at /api/snaplock) that powers the SnapLock
feature. Wired into app.py via:

    import snaplock
    snaplock.init_db()
    snaplock.register_snaplock(app)

Design
------
A user "registers" a real-world object by capturing it from several
angles (front / back / left / right / top / optional bottom). Each
reference photo is run through a locally-loaded, pretrained deep
learning vision model (DINOv2 — Meta AI's self-supervised vision
transformer, specifically strong at fine-grained, instance-level
visual recognition rather than just broad category classification)
to produce a numeric embedding vector — a compact "visual fingerprint"
of that specific physical object instance. No cloud APIs are used and
the model is never retrained; it is used purely as a fixed, pretrained
feature extractor. The embeddings (plus the raw reference images, kept
for reference/debugging) are stored against the object.

Every object also gets its own random 256-bit "Object Vault Key"
(OVK). The OVK is wrapped (encrypted) with a key derived from the
user's chosen Access Password (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM —
the exact same primitives already used by passwordsave.py). The OVK
itself is never stored anywhere in the clear, and the Access Password
is never stored either — "is the password correct" is answered purely
by "did the OVK unwrap succeed", so there is nothing in the database
an attacker could crack offline except by brute-forcing the password
against the AEAD tag directly.

ACCURACY PIPELINE (v2)
-----------------------
The single biggest real-world failure mode of instance-recognition via
a whole-image embedding is background/lighting sensitivity: DINOv2's
CLS-token embedding summarizes the ENTIRE frame, so re-scanning the
same physical object against a different background or under different
lighting shifts the embedding enough to fall below a high similarity
threshold, even though the object itself hasn't changed. This version
adds a preprocessing + embedding pipeline specifically to fix that,
applied IDENTICALLY at registration time and at scan time (consistency
between the two sides is what makes comparison meaningful):

  1. Background removal (rembg / U2Net, pretrained, local, optional
     dependency with graceful fallback to the raw image if unavailable
     or if it fails on a given frame — matching only ever gets
     stricter/safer when this step is skipped, never looser).
  2. Tight crop to the object's bounding box (a free byproduct of the
     background-removal mask) — puts more of DINOv2's fixed input
     resolution onto the actual object instead of empty space.
  3. Lighting normalization (CLAHE on the L channel) so brightness/
     contrast differences between registration and scan lighting
     matter less.
  4. At REGISTRATION time only: a handful of light augmentations
     (small rotations + brightness jitter) of the same captured photo
     are also embedded, and every angle's stored embedding is the
     L2-renormalized AVERAGE of the base photo + its augmented
     variants. This is a lightweight few-shot/robustness trick — it
     gives the object's stored "fingerprint" some built-in tolerance
     to minor viewing-condition changes, without needing the user to
     capture and upload multiple photos per angle, and WITHOUT
     retraining or fine-tuning the underlying model (DINOv2 stays a
     fixed, pretrained feature extractor exactly as before).
  5. Matching still uses plain cosine similarity against
     SNAPLOCK_MATCH_THRESHOLD with a runner-up margin — the fix is in
     making the embeddings themselves more robust, not in loosening
     the comparison logic.

New optional runtime dependencies: `rembg` (background removal) and
`opencv-python-headless` (CLAHE lighting normalization). Both are
loaded lazily and BOTH degrade gracefully — if either is missing or
errors out on a particular image, the pipeline falls back to the
un-normalized image rather than failing the request. This keeps the
"no cloud calls, fixed pretrained extractor" design intact: these are
classical/pretrained preprocessing steps, not additional trainable
models tied to any specific object.

Matching workflow (Scanner Mode)
---------------------------------
1. The live camera frame(s) are run through the SAME background-removal
   + crop + lighting-normalization + DINOv2 pipeline used at
   registration time. The client may send either a single frame
   (field "frame") or several consecutive frames (field "frames",
   multipart, 2-5 recommended) for multi-frame voting — their
   embeddings are averaged into one steadier live embedding before
   comparison, reducing the impact of any single blurry/badly-lit
   frame. Nothing here is ever written to disk; it lives only for the
   duration of the request.
2. That live embedding is compared, via cosine similarity, against
   every stored reference-angle embedding of every object the signed-in
   user has registered. The highest-similarity reference angle for
   each object is that object's score.
3. The highest-scoring object, PROVIDED it clears
   SNAPLOCK_MATCH_THRESHOLD (a high similarity bar) AND beats the
   runner-up object by at least SNAPLOCK_MIN_CANDIDATE_MARGIN, is
   reported as a match. No Access Password is required for this step —
   matching only ever reveals *that* an object matched, never its
   stored content.
4. Only after a successful match does the client ask for the Access
   Password. Only a correct password can unwrap the OVK and therefore
   decrypt any stored password / document content.

Calibrating SNAPLOCK_MATCH_THRESHOLD / SNAPLOCK_MIN_CANDIDATE_MARGIN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Both are environment-overridable (see below) specifically so they can
be tuned from real data instead of guessed:
  1. Register a handful of real objects.
  2. Re-scan each one 15-20 times across different backgrounds/lighting
     and record the "confidence" the /scan/match response returns
     (set SNAPLOCK_DEBUG_SCORES=1 to also get the runner-up score for
     ambiguous-object testing).
  3. Also scan each object against every OTHER registered object once,
     to see the highest cross-object (false-match) score.
  4. Pick SNAPLOCK_MATCH_THRESHOLD comfortably above the highest
     cross-object score and comfortably below the lowest same-object
     score. If those two ranges overlap, that's a signal the reference
     photos for the colliding objects are too visually similar (or too
     few angles were captured) rather than a threshold problem.
